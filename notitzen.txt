✅ Step 1: Where does $user['username'] come from?
You did:

php

$user = $result->fetch_assoc();
That gives you an associative array like:

[
  'username' => 'coolboy123',
  'password' => '$2y$10... (hashed)'
]
So yes — now $user['username'] is the logged-in username pulled from the database.



🧠 What is $stmt?
Think of $stmt as short for “statement” — more specifically:

A prepared statement that gets sent to the database.

🔧 So what does $stmt = $conn->prepare($query) do?
It prepares a SQL query (with placeholders like ?) before it actually sends data to the database.

Why?

To prevent SQL injection.

To allow safely binding real values later (bind_param).

You’re basically telling MySQL:

"Hey, I’m gonna run a query like SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? — I’ll tell you what ? should be in a sec.”
